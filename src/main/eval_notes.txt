Hardware Config:
Clock Polarity (Idle LOW/HIGH): SPI_MODE & Proper Jumper cfg

Software Outline:

- Check if everything is connected and is able to communicate properly (RDCFG)
- Broadcast new (write) configuration (WRCFG) (REFON=1 -> always awake)
- Demo measurements + clear broadcast + check if everything is stuck (measure + CLRCELL broadcast + measure and compare bits)

- Perform 1 measurement and ignore it ?

- Start performing measurements (0xFF are bad)

- Measure transmit speed on each measurement loop. If full measurement cycle performed at sub 100ms, send some CAN data to the ECU ?

#Misc:

Tests:
Do you need ADC Start every time before performing new measurements - yes?
Benchmark ADC Start -> End of ADC Poll time
Benchmark full register read over i2c - volts + status reg // use only status registers?

Notes:
Worse case (26Hz) ADC Conversion time (for all cells) : 201ms
Best case (27KHz) : 1.1ms
(based on specs)

* Use VUV + VOV instead of measuring voltages (RDSTATx + Look at CxOV and CxUV on tables)

*** The LTC6811-2 uses pins 45 through 48 to set the address of the device, by tying these pins to Vâ€“ or VREG (A3-A0 ~ top right)

* Overlap cell measurement (use 2 ADCs for same cell) (ADOL) ?
* Open wire check (ADOW) - startup only ?
