# BMS
This is the core of the BMS that is under active development.

For the best experience and to avoid conflicts, please check out on
a different branch while messing with this subfolder

This is aimed towards teensy 3.1 & 3.2 . 

If you wish to mess with a different, incompatible MCU, you should create a folder under /src/{mcu-name_version} if you are to make any change that is going to break compatibility with teensy versions used here.

Take a look at /lib/dc1942/README.md for porting guides.
